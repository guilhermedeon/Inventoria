# Inventoria

This is an inventory management system inspired by MMORPGs idea of inventory.

## Key Features:

- Multiple inventories: Each user can have multiple inventories, such as a backpack, an entire house, a storage unit...
- Tags: Items can be tagged with custom tags for easy organization and filtering.
- Restock: items can be configured to have a "low" threshold, and the system can notify users when they need to restock.
- Maintenance: items can have a maintenance interval, and the system can notify users when an item needs maintenance.
- Maintenance log: items can have a maintenance log to keep track of all maintenance performed on the item.
- WIP: This concept is still waay too fresh in my mind, so expect a lot of changes and new features in the future.
